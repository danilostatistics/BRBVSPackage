## Resubmission

This is a resubmission after received the comments from Benjamin Altmann

* I have modified the description, now is 'class of copula curvival model(s) in high dimensional domain'. I added 'domain' at the end.
* I have removed spaces in the description
* Now  only  beginnings and names in the description text are capitalized.

* Quoting R packages "You used to be able to use \donttest{} for a similar purpose, but we no longer recommend it because CRAN sets a special flag that causes the code to be executed anyway.ï¸Ž"So I could not pass from\dontrun to \donttest in R\BRBVS.R.

* In R/BRBVS.R; R/plot.R I removed (<<-). 
* In R/measure.R; R/rbvs_user.R I removed the information messages in the console.
* Modified the version in description and citation passing from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1.
